<h4>Phase 1: Brainstorming</h4>

<p class="margin"></p>
This project has had some changes since I have started the course. My orignal idea was to use EEG sensors to understand the emotional state of a person. These emotional states will be used to derive journal prompts. The follow on prompts would change based on the changed emotional state of the person. Unfortunately, this idea would be too complex from a data analysis standpoint. So I decided to go with a more simpler project. This new project would be a wearble device like a braclet that would were the device software analyzes the heart rate data to determine the user’s emotional or stress level (e.g., relaxed, anxious, excited). Based on this analysis, it generates journal prompts tailored to encourage reflection on the user’s current state. For example, a higher heart rates might trigger prompts related to managing stress or excitement, while lower rates could lead to prompts focused on gratitude or calmness.

**Supplies**

- PPG Device
  - ~~MAX30100~~ or MAX30102
- ESP32 Board
- 3D Molded housing for ESP32 and PPG device
- Some type of small lcd interface to view prompts
- Battery

<p class="margin"></p>

**Software**: 


- Algorithm for interpreting heart rate data. MAX30102 library
- a database of journal prompts categorized by emotional state

<p class="margin"></p>

**Design**


- a strap or braclet
  - start with PLA for protoype
  - Final product: PETG (Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol)

<h4>Phase 2: Prototyping</h4>

<p class="margin"></p>
The prototyping phase of this started when we learned about input devices. This helped me figure out the type of sensor I would want to use for the device. I narrowed it down to two sensors. The MAX3010 or the MAX30102. I decided to go with the MAX30102 due to the better accuracy of the sensor and a recent study that came out about the sensor located here: https://www.mdpi.com/2673-4591/16/1/9 .The sensor shape determines the foundation for the size and shape of the device.
