<h4>Assignment 1: Create a Box</h4> 

For this assignment we were tasked with creating a shoe sized box to hold our class items. This project started a little challenging for me because I had issues with my laptop. I quickly realized that the laptop I had gotten was lacking a bit in processing power to properly use the CAD software. Thankfully I was able to use my desktop Mac instead. The CAD software was pretty easy to install and the tutorial provided by Nathan gave me a straight forward process on how to build my box on fushion 360. I had also took notes during class that gave me some reference material that came in handy later.

Using Nathans tutorial I set out to build my first box. Using the parameter settings made it easy to adjust the sizes. One initial issue I had was getting the right side of the box to turn blue in the CAD software. When it doesn’t turn blue when you hover over a section it means that the box is not fully enclosed. I went to open lab and worked with Bobby to remedy the issue. The issue was an incorrect setting when I went to expand the box.

After this issue was remedied I use the mirror function to create separate mirror points. I learned that when you hover your mouse over the middle of the box it will turn into a “triangle” this triangle means that you are at the center. After creating the mirror points I was able to mirror the sides of the box over.

Once I felt happy with the box it was time to export the box. This is where I ran into another issue. I initially exported the document by going to file -> export. For some reason when exporting this way my dimensions would not properly show up when I put the file into Rhino. Bobby showed me the proper way to export by right clicking the sketch and exporting as dxf. I put the file on the thumb drive and imported into the Rhino computer next to the laser cutter. My sketch showed up with the right dimensions. Unfortunately, I had duplicate lines which through off my kerf. This kept my box from properly closing. To fix the issue I used the explode function on rhino as well as the “dup” function to find and delete all of the duplicate lines. Once all of the duplicate lines were deleted I changed the layers of various lines. I set the inner rectangle line to the etch layer and the outside lines to the cut layer. I then used ctrl p to verify the lay out and move the file to the laser cut software. Once the software was up and running I turned on the laser cuter and put in a piece of cardboard. Once the cardboard was in the cutter I used the software to move the laser to the outer boundaries of my template to make sure there was enough cardboard for my box. After this was done I chose med board from the cut settings and turned up the power of the etch to about 14% to ensure the laser would cut enough cardboard away for the box to fold properly. After this I sent the file to be lasered. The box came out as expected except one part of the box was double cut by the laser and it would not close properly in the fingers. I ended up having to use tape to get one side of the box to close.

<h4>Assignment 2: Fusion 360 Tutorial</h4>

<p class="margin">   </p>
The tutorial that I decided to use was a lego brick. This was one of the first results that popped up when I searched for fushion 360 tutorials for begginers. The steps were similar to the box tutorial provided by Nathan. The biggest difference was using the extrude command to make something 3D. The tutorial was also helpful because I learned a few short cut keys. My favorite being E for extrude. I also decided to add a decal to my lego brick.

The item I decided to assemble is a binder clip that is composed of two pieces. The first piece is a paper clip that is used as a handle and the second piece is the part that latches on to what you want clamped. I chose these items because it was easily accessable and I have seen previous tutorials on the assembly. Creating the model of this was harder than I expected. First I needed to dissasemble the clip in order to get the measurement. This was my first time using a caliper so it took me some time to get the measurements. After I had the measurements I went to work on fushion.
