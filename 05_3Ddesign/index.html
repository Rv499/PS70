<h4>Assignment: Design and Print Something</h4>

This week for the print assignment I wanted to work on printing a round device. The inspiration was for my final project. At the moment I think my project will include some tyep of device that will either go around the finger or the wrist. This device will house a sensor that will measure a person's heart rate. I designed a ring type device on fushion. I created a shape and then used the revolve tool to make it circular.

After I created the device I exported it into a stl file and brought it into prusa slicer.

The next device I wanted to print was the lego that I designed in the earlier weeks. This design was built using a youtube tutorial. I exported the design into prusa. The design was smaller than I expected but I was okay with it due to the short print time.

<h4>Assignment: Scan Something</h4>

I used the lidar scanner on my phone using the app polycam to scan a book on my bookshelf. The scanner on the phone did not work as well as I wanted.
