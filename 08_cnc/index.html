<h4>Assignment: Make Something With CNC</h4>


This week we were tasked with making something with the CNC. I decided I wanted to make something involving my old military logo. I found a tutorial on youtube on how to turn an image into a dxf file. I used this website https://convertio.co to convert an old logo I have on my computer into a DXF file. Once the file was converted I downloaded the file and uploaded the file into autocad.

<div class="class\">
  <img src="mark.png" alt="Marine Raider Logo">
</div>
<p class="Marine Raider Logo"></p>

<p class="margin">   </p>
<div class="class\">
  <img src="mark 2.png" width= "75%" alt="Marine Raider Logo in fushion">
</div>
<p class="DXF version of Marine Raider Logo"></p>

Once the image was uploaded into fushion, I was ready for the next step. It was now time to create tool paths.
