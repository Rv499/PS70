<h4>Assignment: Minimum Viable Product for Final Project</h4>

This week we were tasked with creating a MVP. The part of my project that I decided to focus on was the programing a sensor to detect heart rate and using the heart rate to generate journal prompts. When first starting off I tried 3 different sensors before settling on 1. the 3 various sensors I tried was MAX30102, Orignal Pulse Sensor and CSY147 Pulse sensor. I ultimately decided to go with the orignial pulse sensor sense they had sample codes and a large amount of youtube video tutorial videos available. After watching their youtube vidoes I wired the sensor accordingly. After the wiring I tried one of the sample codes to ensure the sensor could detect my heart rate. I had issues getting the heart rate to be detected in the serial plotter. I decided to change the baud to 115200 and the heart rate started to show up! After I got a consistent heart rate I then wanted to check the accuracy. The closes device I had to a heart rate monitor was my apple watch. My pulse sensor and apple watch return similar BPM +/- 3 bpm. This was a great a sign. The next step was the hardest. I needed to program the various heart rates to print a journal prompt instead of just the BPM. To make things simple I started with 3 journal prompts. 1 prompt is less than 80, the other is 80 -100 and the last is higher than 100.

<h4>Next Steps</h4>

Next I will continue to troubleshoot the screen. I would like the journal prompts to display on the screen. I will also need a battery in order to power both the sensor and the screen. I will need a memory card to store pictures and more prompts. And lastely I will create a housing for device so it can be worn or at least look presentable. My other goal which is overally ambitious will be able to sync online to AI to help generate more adhoc type prompts.
